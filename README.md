# Disease-Plant-Identification
Disease Identification is end-to-end computer vision project that allow user to identify disease in a plant leaf by giving the picture to the system. After the system identify the disease, it will give the user the treatment and pesticide (more than one) recommendation for the plant. We hope that this project can help Indonesian farmers in caring for crops.
